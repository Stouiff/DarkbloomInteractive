Hello, I'm Stephane, an Unreal Engine 5 Technical Artist in the Virtual Reality industry, but I will only focus on my personal project on here. This blog is a way for me to share my progress and understanding of the Unreal Engine 4 rendering pipeline, through the development of a custom version of the engine, as well as game development. 

Throughout the blog, I will refer to my custom version of Unreal as [[Ephemere Engine]], to make it easier to distinct from the vanilla version of Unreal Engine. 

I'm currently working on two games, the first one, [[Argenta]], currently in active development alongside the engine. The second one, [[Stillworld]], is a much more ambitious project, so I'm just working on writing for now until I have a more robust version of the Engine to work full time on it. Both of theses games might have a devlog on their own later as I go through more interesting stuff than just programming a character or environment block-out haha.
