<p>Throughout the blog, I will refer to my custom version of Unreal as [[Ephemere Engine]], to make it easier to distinct from the vanilla version of Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on two games, the first one, [[Argenta]], currently in active development alongside the engine. The second one, [[Stillworld]], is a much more ambitious project, so I&rsquo;m just working on writing for now until I have a more robust version of the Engine to work full time on it. Both of theses games might have a devlog on their own later as I go through more interesting stuff than just programming a character or environment block-out haha.</p>
